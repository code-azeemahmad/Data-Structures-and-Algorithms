Brute Force Approach:
--> Definition: Try all possible solutions and pick the best one.
--> Works fine for small inputs, but very slow for large ones.
--> Often uses nested loops.



Optimal Approach
--> Use a smarter technique to solve the same problem with fewer computations.
--> Uses mathematical reasoning, patterns, or algorithms to reduce work.
--> Much faster, especially for large inputs.
